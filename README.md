# ANN
Repository for the codes of the Artificial Neural Networks discipline of the Electrical Engineering Department (DEE)-UFMG's bachelor program.

Sorry for the organization on the first classes' codes, I'm learning through the course the best way to do the exercises fast maintaing good code practices.
If you want some explanation, feel free to contact me, I'll be glad to help.

Lessons 1 to 3 uses an MCP. If you want a better MCP algorithm, I recommend you to go to [Simple MCP](https://github.com/marciorasf/simple-mcp). This is a generic MCP that I implemented based on what I've learned on those lessons.
